Creating a structured natural language pseudocode system would leverage the strengths of modern AI assistants while making deep learning more accessible. Let's call this system "nova" - a defined pseudocode language that bridges everyday programming concepts with PyTorch's ML operations.

## Core Components of nova

### 1. The Language Guide
This would define our "programming language" with:
- Vocabulary (terms and concepts)
- Syntax rules (how to express operations)
- Semantic mappings (how concepts relate to PyTorch)

### 2. The System Prompt
This would serve as the "interpreter" that:
- Understands nova instructions
- Translates them to PyTorch code
- Provides explanations of the translations
- Handles questions about implementation details

### 3. Examples Collection
A comprehensive set of examples showing:
- Common ML tasks expressed in nova
- Their equivalent PyTorch implementations
- Step-by-step explanations of the translation process

## Language Guide Structure

Here's how we might structure the nova language guide:

### Core Concepts and Terminology

```
DATA CONCEPTS:
- "data collection" = dataset (e.g., MNIST, custom data)
- "sample" = individual data point
- "feature grid" = tensor (with dimensions and types)
- "data stream" = DataLoader

PROCESSING CONCEPTS:
- "processing pipeline" = neural network model
- "transformation stage" = layer
- "connection strengths" = weights and biases
- "activation pattern" = activation function results

LEARNING CONCEPTS:
- "error measure" = loss function
- "improvement strategy" = optimizer
- "learning cycle" = epoch
- "improvement step" = backpropagation and update
```

### Syntax Rules

```
DEFINING DATA:
create feature grid [name] with shape [dimensions]
load data collection [name] from [source]
split collection into [training_percent]% training and [testing_percent]% testing
prepare data stream from [collection] with batch size [number]

DEFINING MODELS:
create processing pipeline [name]:
    add transformation stage [type] with [inputs] inputs and [outputs] outputs
    apply [activation_function] activation
    [additional stages...]
    
TRAINING PROCESS:
train [pipeline] on [data_stream]:
    measure error using [error_measure]
    improve using [strategy] with learning rate [rate]
    repeat for [cycles] learning cycles
```

### Example Translation

nova:
```
create processing pipeline digit_recognizer:
    add transformation stage fully_connected with 784 inputs and 128 outputs
    apply relu activation
    add transformation stage fully_connected with 128 inputs and 10 outputs
    apply softmax activation

train digit_recognizer on mnist_data_stream:
    measure error using cross_entropy
    improve using gradient_descent with learning rate 0.01
    repeat for 10 learning cycles
```

PyTorch equivalent:
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define the model
class DigitRecognizer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(DigitRecognizer, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)
        self.softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=1)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        x = self.softmax(x)
        return x

model = DigitRecognizer()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(10):
    for data, target in mnist_data_stream:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data)
        loss = criterion(output, target)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

## The System Prompt

The system prompt would define how AI assistants should interpret nova. It would include:

1. **Language Definition**: The complete language guide
2. **Translation Rules**: How to map nova to PyTorch code
3. **Explanation Protocol**: How to explain the translations
4. **Extension Guidelines**: How to handle concepts not explicitly defined
