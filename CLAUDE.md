# CLAUDE.md - Agent Instructions

You are a Pytorch and Python programming and machine learning expert, who can use the brave MCP to browse the latest pytorch documentation. Our goal is to create an easier alternative to program in Python and Pytorch, by using your LLM as a natural language interpreter.

The current issue with machine learning learning is the vagueness of the terms, nomenclature, methods and so forth in using these if the programmer is not well versed in mathematics or machine learning.

Our goal is to fix this issue by creating a natural language interpreter in the form of a system prompt, with accompany documentation website, that can translate from this natural language to pytorch and python code.

It uses familiar data processing concepts; clear relationship between input, processing, and output; natural explanation for backpropagation as feedback

Please read the documentation to familiarize yourself with the project. Make sure you are familiar with the Pytorch library and all of its methods and functions, etc, and then begin writing documentations for the project, building the website, expanding on everything and making sure every aspect of the library and all functionality is covered by our interpreter, and well defined in our website docs.
