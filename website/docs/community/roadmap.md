## Feature Requests and Prioritization

We welcome community input on feature prioritization. If you have a feature request or would like to see something moved up in priority, please:

1. Check if it's already on the roadmap
2. Submit a feature request on GitHub if it's not
3. Vote on existing feature requests to help us understand community priorities

## Contributing to the Roadmap

If you're interested in contributing to items on the roadmap:

1. Check the [Contributing Guide](contributing.md) for general contribution guidelines
2. Look for issues labeled with "roadmap" on GitHub
3. Comment on the issue to express your interest
4. Submit a proposal or pull request with your implementation

## Versioning Policy

Nova follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Major versions** (1.0.0, 2.0.0): Introduce breaking changes
- **Minor versions** (0.1.0, 0.2.0): Add new features in a backward-compatible manner
- **Patch versions** (0.1.1, 0.1.2): Include backward-compatible bug fixes

## Release Schedule

We aim to release:

- **Patch releases**: As needed for bug fixes
- **Minor releases**: Every 2-3 months
- **Major releases**: When significant breaking changes are necessary

## Experimental Features

Some features may be released as experimental before being fully integrated:

- Experimental features will be clearly marked in the documentation
- They may change or be removed in future versions
- Feedback on experimental features is especially valuable

## Deprecation Policy

When features need to be deprecated:

1. They will be marked as deprecated in a minor release
2. A migration path will be provided
3. They will be removed in the next major release
4. Deprecation notices will be included in release notes

## Community Roadmap Meetings

We hold regular community meetings to discuss roadmap priorities:

- Meetings are announced on GitHub and our community channels
- Anyone is welcome to attend and provide input
- Meeting notes and decisions are published for transparency
