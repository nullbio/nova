# Nova: Natural Language Interface for Deep Learning

Nova is a natural language interpreter that bridges the gap between intuitive human understanding and PyTorch's machine learning operations. It allows programmers and non-experts to express machine learning concepts and operations using natural language, which is then translated into functional PyTorch code.

## Why Nova?

Machine learning and deep learning come with steep learning curves due to complex terminology, mathematical concepts, and programming patterns. Nova addresses these challenges by:

1. **Simplifying Terminology**: Replacing jargon with intuitive terms
2. **Conceptualizing Models as Pipelines**: Using the familiar data transformation pipeline paradigm
3. **Abstracting Implementation Details**: Focusing on intent rather than syntax
4. **Providing Educational Bridges**: Connecting intuitive understanding with technical implementation

## Core Components

### 1. The Nova Language
A structured natural language pseudocode system with:
- Defined vocabulary that maps to PyTorch concepts
- Intuitive syntax for expressing ML operations
- Semantic mappings to PyTorch functionality

### 2. The Nova Interpreter
An AI-powered system that:
- Understands Nova instructions
- Translates them to executable PyTorch code
- Explains the translation process
- Answers questions about implementation details

### 3. Examples and Templates
A growing collection of:
- Common ML tasks expressed in Nova
- Their equivalent PyTorch implementations
- Step-by-step explanations of the translation process
